# CPG Contract Checker (CCC)
This project aims to identify known smart contract vulnerabilities in code snippets as well as compilable contracts in 
the Ethereum Smart Contract ecosystem.
The analysis is performed on a semantic CPG of source code, which makes this tool especially fit to identify coding
issues in the early development cycle. The main purpose of this repository is to allow replication of a scientific
study on smart contracts and enable practitioners to analyze their predeployed smart contracts.

## Status
This branch is currently undergoing export control checks and the OpenSource process. The source code will be made available here once these have been completed.
